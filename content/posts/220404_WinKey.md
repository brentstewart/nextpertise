My son's computer blew up and we didn't have a copy of the Windows key.  This is something I have run into before - I typically blow Windows off new PCs and install Linux, but then occassionally want to create a Windows VM using that key.  It used to be on a sticker on the laptop, but it's not anymore.  It turns out a copy of the key is stored in BIOS or UEFI and accessible via ACPI.  ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an abstract interface that provides a standrard way to access hardware functions.

## Discovering Windows Keys in BIOS using Linux
ACPI tables are stored in /sys/firmware/acpi/tables.  As an administrator, you can read those text files to see the various settings and values.  The table with the Windows key is MSDM.  

    sudo strings /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/MSDM

## Discovering Windows Keys in BIOS using Windows
I've seen some tools to grab the key from ACPI under Windows.  I haven't used any of these tools, but this is simple to get from a Windows command line.

Although this blog is primarily focused on technical topics, I've sprinkled in some thoughts about managing.  I've been involved with IT management for a long time and have developed some opinions.  It's important to note, before I share advice, that being in management is about _results_ or it doesn't matter.  So, like dieting, do what works for you.

Poor managers can get results, but it typically involves leaving a trail of bodies.  Pyrrhric practices degrade the capabilities of the team over time and make it harder to get results, so good managers not only get results but do it in a way that builds the team up in the process.

Management is an administrative function - sorting the papers into the right piles.  Although our job title may be "manager", what we want to be is a _leader_.  Leadership is about convincing a group of individuals to share a vision and to accomplish something together.  To be the manager you want to be, to be the leader you think you are, you need to be able to deal with people.

If you build an organization that lays out each step, you may get compliance but you won't get folks to really engage.  The key to really getting the most out of folks is to provide direction and some autonomy and allow them to find their own path.  Sometimes they will suprise you and go in a direction you didn't expect.  This can be the magic of working with a good team.

Sometimes people take advantage of autonomy to do less than you would expect.  The easy trap to fall into is to just fire anyone who isn't producing, but since everyone goes through periods of ennui this mostly just churns the staff.  I've heard it said that you deserve what you tolerate, and recognizing the limits of your toleration and correcting folks early can help them get back on track.

Not everyone will live up to your expectations, even after you've taken the time to remind them.  It's important to recognize the limits of your tolerance.  Releasing someone who is disengaged can help that person find an opportunity that excites them, and it is often a tremendous boost to morale.  It can be tremendously de-motivating to have to work with someone who doesn't give a flip.


It is so easy to justify performance problems.  We all have bad days.  Sometimes hardware just fails.  They were here all night.  I can't argue against any of those thoughts, but a good manager guards against moving from being understanding to actively justifying.  This is doubly true because very few people (and managers are people) like to be confrontational.  Rather than put yourself through the pain of a - many times emotional - arguement, it's so much nice to just let it go.

I think it's important to realize that employee performance is charted in terms of intention and capability.  Intention is a measure of the person - do they want to succeed, are they pleasant and supportive, do they hustle?  Capability is specific to the job, and reflects how well they do it.  Both of these dimensions are contextual.  I don't want to be your dentist and I wouldn't be very good at it, but I'd love to talk to you about IT Security.

I think it's easy to let someone go when they're a pain.  There are very nice and honorable people who just don't understand how to work in IT, and dealing with these folks is troublesome.  You have to remember that intention has to be matched with proficiency.

I've created a seperate site - [Stewart.tc](https://www.stewart.tc) - to house my book reviews, discoveries, and thoughts on non-Internet subjects.

I titled this "IMHO" or "in my humble opinion", but I've always tried to avoid opinions in this space on non-technical topics.  Even the "non-technical" tag is about Internet topics for presentation to non-techies.

I started writing because I enjoy sharing what I've learned and because I enjoy writing and wanted to develop the skill by making it more of a discipline.  Writing helps to organize thoughts and get them out of your head.  The idea that I can pursue IT ideas that fascinate me and share those findings with others has been great, and along the way I've discovered that I refer back to my own writing fairly often to remember how to do _that thing_.  

As I've grown and my circumstances have evolved, I've had less time to pursue IT ideas but more time to think on other topics.  I tried to include some of that here, for instance in the book reviews, but in the end felt that it was best persued in a seperate forum.  So, if you have enjoyed my book notes or are interested in my thoughts on deconstructionism, I invite you to check out the new site.  I moved the book reviews over to that site, but there's not much else there so far so you may want to check back in a few weeks.

This site will continue, probably at about the same pace, and I hope that it will continue to occassionally offer something of use to you.

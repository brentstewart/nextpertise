GNS3 2.2.16 was released today. This release has a number of bug fixes that are mostly around Qemu and HyperV support. Of general interest, there's a patch for a bug in capturing packets with Wireshark. I had an issue open involving downloading appliances from the application and that was fixed as well. This shapes up to be a good polish on a great application and I wouldn't be surprised if this attention didn't translate into generally better performance in other areas.

## Should you upgrade?

This version doesn't include a security fix. The VM improvements will help those running KVM or HyperV. There are some bug-fixes that will be of general interest, but aren't critical. I recommend upgrading _assuming you have a little time to sort out any issues_.

My personal experience with GNS3 has been that _most_ upgrades go without a hitch. I usually just go for it, but I'm not typically dependent on GNS3 from day to day. When I have had issues, they've been resolvable with an hour or two of concentration. **Note** that _gns3-gui_ and _gns3-server_ have to be the exact same version. If for some reason you upgrade one, you either have to roll back or upgrade the other.

## How do you upgrade?

On Windows, just download the executable and run it. On Ubuntu, **sudo apt upgrade**. If you have a server VM (and I recommend it), start by getting a snapshot of your current server. I once had a server upgrade go poorly that resulted in rebuilding my VM, so this is a realistic risk. After that, log into the server and you can kick-off the upgrade from the menu.

## New and updated appliances

Folks continue to contribute appliances. If you are interested in doing this, refer to my articles on [creating an appliance](/Creating_GNS3_appliance) and [Updating an appliance](/UpdatingGNS3Appliances). Here's a list of the new and updated appliances since September first:

- IPCop
- Raspian
- Arista VEOS
- Aruba VGW
- Cisco DCNM, IOSv L2, and IOSXRV9k
- Extreme VOSS
- F5 BIG-IP
- Huawei AR1KV, CE12800, NE40e, and USG6KV
- Juniper VMX , VRR, and VQFX
- OpenWRT
- OPNSense
- TACACS
- TinyCore
- Ubuntu
- Vyos

Wow! That's a lot. I added IPCop and Raspian and described the process in those [earlier](/Creating_GNS3_appliance) and [articles](/UpdatingGNS3Appliances). I'm particularly excited about the Huawei additions. That's been a big gap and it's really nice to see that supported. Big thanks to "iceking2nd" for building those!

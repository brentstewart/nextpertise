I got a sad little note today from Amazon - Honeycode, their no-code environment, is shutting down.  According to the post, no new signups are allowed.  Existing users have until the end of February, 2024, to pull their data.

Honeycode was one of my early encounters with no-code environments on the web.  It had a vibe like early Access - someone with a good understanding of third normal form could pretty quickly create and join tables, design an interface, and deploy an app.  Like Access, advanced users could do some basic scripting to extend it's capabilities.  It would automatically run in IOS, Android, and the web so your code was available anywhere.

I gather that it continued to improve, but when I encountered it last summer it had some rough spots.  There wasn't a good way to import, export, or link to outside data sources.  You couldn't get a "configuration" description.  If you'd have been able to link this to S3 buckets and output your schema and frontend in something like YAML, I could picture a ton of people building everyday apps and sharing them on GitHub.  As it was, your app was a little lonely island.

I never really saw a path to moneytize it.  You couldn't sell an app that you created - they executed inside the Honeycode app.  You couldn't share your app or your data.  In the end, I understand the retirement.

I saw references to similar environments online in the obits, including Coda, Carrd, and Bubble.  I haven't had time yet to check them out, but if I get the chance I'll report back.  For the moment it's sufficient to appreciate what Honeycode accomplished in it's brief life and to appreciate the people who put it together.

# Two months ago, I warned of issues with the 5.35 driver

Since the initial post, I tried 5.35 after a rev and found that it worked well.  Until today.  

    nvidia-smi

I used _nvidia-smi_ this time and was able to see that - although dpkg showed the files installed, the driver wasn't loaded.  I found some instructions from Michael Murphy on [Lemmy.world] that helped to resolve this.

    sudo apt purge ~nnvidia
    sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535
    sudo reboot

## Keep this handy
There's definitely something funky about 5.35.  I haven't had this problem before and this machine has been stable for a couple years now.  It's probably a good idea to keep this idea in mind when you install the latest drivers.

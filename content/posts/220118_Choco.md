I'm setting up a new Windows 10 VM (this time in VMWare) and decided to use Chocolatey to install applications this time, since I tried _winget_ last time.  I haven't tried Chocolatey in a while, and I've spent a lot of time exclusively in Linux since then so I was curious what I would make of it, especially in comparison to _Winget_.

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a package manager like apt.  You can use it to search for, install, update, and uninstall programs.  This is particularly useful if you have a "standard setup" for new computers - it's possible to build a script to install the apps you expect.  Windows Update only covers Microsoft programs, so Chocolatey fills another gap by updating all the programs it installs from the command line.

## Chocolatey 
Chocolatey is free open-souce software that has been around for a while and I've used it before.  Chocolatey works like _apt_, using the _choco_ command.  You can search for a package, install it, or uninstall it. _Choco upgrade_ will upgrade all the Chocolatey-managed applications on your system.  This last piece is especially useful, since Windows Update focuses just on Microsoft properties.

Chocolatey uses the command _choco_.  The command sequence below shows looking for all packages in the repository that are include "libre".  That allows me to see the name of the LibreWolf package, which I then choose to install.  Finally, the upgrade command can be used to upgrade specific packages or to get them all.

    choco list libre
    choco install librewolf
    choco upgrade all

Use _choco list --local-only_ to see a list of programs installed on the local system by choco.  There's also a GUI, installed by _choco install chocolateygui_.  

Choco compares very well to Microsoft's _winget_.  The application set available seems a little larger.  Like _winget_, choco will be familiar to _apt_ users (but there are some syntactical differences.  I used winget to easily install Git, WinFSP, SSHFS, the Microsoft Terminal, and Librewolf.   A later upgrade picked up new versions of Librewolf and Git and installed them without difficulty.   _Choco_ also seemed to apply some KB patches I was missing and even upgraded itself!

## Installation
Setup is very easy.  Installation can be done from an administrative powershell using these commands:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    
## Pretty Solid

When I tried winget, I had issues with dependencies.  Chocolatey picked these up and installed without an issue, so Librewolf grabbed the Visual C redistributable module and installed it without prompting, for instance.  _Choco_ has a wide range of supported applications, particularly if you like to use FOSS.

The biggest issue with Chocolatey is image.  The name doesn't build credibility, and with Microsoft building a competing product now I expect IT departments to focus on _winget_.  That said, _choco_ is a more complete solution with a bigger catalog as of today and it's definitely the better fit for home.

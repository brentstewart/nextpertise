GNS3 2.2.15 is out. Not much to report . . . reviewing the release notes indicates thi is mostly bug fixes.

## Should you upgrade?

This version doesn't include a security fix, and the bug fixes aren't issues I've run into.

My personal experience with GNS3 has been that _most_ upgrades go without a hitch. I usually just go for it, but I'm not typically dependent on GNS3 from day to day. **Note** that _gns3-gui_ and _gns3-server_ have to be the exact same version. If for some reason you upgrade one, you either have to roll back or upgrade the other.

## How do you upgrade?

On Windows, just download the executable and run it. On Ubuntu, **sudo apt upgrade**. If you have a server VM (and I recommend it), start by getting a snapshot of your current server. I once had a server upgrade go poorly that resulted in rebuilding my VM, so this is a realistic risk. After that, log into the server and you can kick-off the upgrade from the menu.

I ran into an issue upgrading the server side - docker-ce was missing a dependency. To resolve, I dropped down the shell and used docker's instructions for installing on an Ubuntu host.

> sudo apt-get update  
> sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common  
> curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -  
> sudo apt-get update  
> sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

After that, I rebooted and re-initiated the upgrade to 2.2.15 and everything worked. The experience reiterates my point that GNS3 server upgrades sometimes have problems that can easily knock you off your game for a few days. Make sure you have a good backup before upgrading, or that you are not under time pressure.

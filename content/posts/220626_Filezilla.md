    When you first start Filezilla, local files are on the left and remote files are on the right.  Because you haven't connected anywhere, the right will be blank.  Note the path is shown above the files.
    You can "quick connect" by typing in the particulars in this row.  To attach to a remote FTP server, for instance, you might fill in host with "1.2.3.4" or "ftp.makingthisup.com".  Username and password are for the remote system.  Specify port 21 for FTP and 22 for SFTP.  Then click the button.
    OR you can click the top left icon which let's you create "bookmarks" for sites you use often.  Once that screen opens, click New Site and fill in the particulars.  Select protocol and the port will be automatically determined.  Fill in the host.  The logon types are:
        Anonymous - don't trust any site using this ðŸ™‚
        Normal - just fill in the user/pass below.
        Ask - it will pop a box for login when you connect.
        Interactive - not really sure, don't recall using that
        Key file - used if you have a cryptographic key supplied by an SFTP server owner.  If you are using FTP you don't need this.
        Once you're done, click OK to save it or "Connect" to save and to start a session immediately.
    This is where the remote files will appear.  It's like file manager, just click to browse.  ".." is used to go up a level.

    Anything more complicated, call me.

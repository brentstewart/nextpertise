This website is a place where we can write about and share the things we're working on.  Our interests are varied, so the content will range a bit.  Your respectful thoughts and suggestions are welcomed.  Articles will be updated as better ideas emerge!

To help you make the most of the site, the articles are tagged in a way that lets you filter to the posts you need.  Some articles will have a youtube reference; this will point to a youtube channel where a video version of the article is available.  Some articles have a github reference.  As much as possible, we will create a repository of each project so that you can clone and improve it.

Finally, we've learned these things through the works of others.  Where possible, attributions or additional references for further reading have been included.

We wish you the best on your journey!

## About Brent Stewart
I have been in the IT industry for about 30 years.  Early in my career, I benefitted enormously from a knowledgeable mentor.  I've found that my default approach to a lot of my career has been to teach, whether I'm part of a team, leadership, working with clients, or explaining things to management.  I hope that I've been able to mentor others along the way and "pay it forward."

I have a Bachelor's in Physics and a Masters in Computer Science / Information Security.  I've written numerous books, mostly for Cisco Press.  I've included links below to the ones still in print.  I've been employed as an IT Director and I've included my LinkedIn profile below - feel free to link to me and please mention that you saw my website!

My professional interests include:
* Networking
* Security
* Linux
* Virtualization
* Automation and Cloud

My PCs all run Linux (mostly Ubuntu variants) and I work with and contribute to GNS3, so those topics will come up on this site.  On a personal note, I've been married 24 years and have four kids!

_Lieutenant Hornblower_ picks up a bit after _Mr. Midshipman Hornblower_.  This continues the story of a British seaman during Napoleanic days.

For fiction, I'm not going to give a detailed review of the book.  I'm just going to answer two questions:

## Did I enjoy it?
I'm two for two on this series - I've enjoyed both.  This book has, until the ending section, a lot of inertia as Hornblower moves from one situation to another.  Interestingly, the author chooses to shift focus from third person focused on Hornblower to a third person focused on another Lieutenant, telling Hornblower's story as it is seen from a peers perspective.  I can't think of another book that takes a similar tact and it's surprising to shift perspective after the first book, but it works.


## Do I recommend it?

If you tried the first book and enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this book.

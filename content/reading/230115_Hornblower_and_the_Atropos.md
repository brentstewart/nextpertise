_Hornblower and the Atropos_ continues directly from _Horblower and the Hostspur_.  This continues the story of a British seaman during Napoleanic days.

For fiction, I'm not going to give a detailed review of the book.  I'm just going to answer two questions:

## Did I enjoy it?
This is the fourth book in the series and I've enjoyed each of them.  The story covers his first command of a ship of the line.  It starts with a trip across England with his family and his duties around the funeral of Nelson.  The second part is about an expedition to the Meditaranian and off the Turkish coast.

## Do I recommend it?
It's definitely an aquired taste as it goes on.  Forester tends to wander in his narration and the nautical lingo takes some wading into.  I've picked up some from context, some from research, and some I've decided isn't important.  That said, if you can find peace with that part then these books offer a fascinating viewpoint and a good story (eventually).

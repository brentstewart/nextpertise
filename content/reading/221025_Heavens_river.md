_Heaven's River_ is book 4 in the "Bobiverse".  The concept of the series is the Bob was a 21st century programmer whose head was cryogenically preserved after death.  He is resurrected many years later as the intelligence of a Von Neumann probe (an interstellar probe that clones itself).  The series takes a long view over human history after-Earth and touches on interesting ideas of individuality, moral philosophy, and the nature of a soul.

For fiction, I'm not going to give a detailed review of the book.  I'm just going to answer two questions:

## Did I enjoy it?
I've enjoyed the whole series.  It's interesting and Taylor has found interesting ways to maintain interest past the initial concept.


## Do I recommend it?

Yes-ish.  _Heaven's River_ picks up quickly from _All These Worlds_ (book 3).  It's been a year or so since I read book 3 and I struggled at times to remember characters or distinguish between "Bobs".  That's balanced a bit because Taylor doesn't iterate through as many narrators in this book.  I enjoy the series and look forward to the next book.  For readers new to the series, start with _We are Legion_.

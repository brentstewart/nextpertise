_Hornblower and the Hotspur_ continues directly from _Lieutenant Horblower_.  This continues the story of a British seaman during Napoleanic days.

For fiction, I'm not going to give a detailed review of the book.  I'm just going to answer two questions:

## Did I enjoy it?
This is the third book in the series and I've enjoyed each of them.  The stayed up late reading in bed and lost sleep kind of enjoyed.

The story continues the friendship of Hornblower and Lt. Bush, tells of Hornblowers' first command, and of his marriage and the children.  Foster never seems in a hurry to drive to he obvious parts of the tale and thus, even with a relatively slow pace, the story takes unexpected turns.

## Do I recommend it?

If you tried the first two books and enjoyed them, you'll enjoy this book.  Beware that there's a lot of technical language around sailing.  I have come to understand enough to enjoy the story, but it can be a bit to wade through.

My favourite Operating System (Kali Linux) has a new release: 2020.4. 

The changes in this version include, but not limited to: ZSH is now Kali’s new default shell on desktop images and cloud, Bash remains the default shell for other platforms (ARM, containers, NetHunter, WSL) for the time being. Users can, of course, use that which they prefer, but be aware that, visually, Bash has been made to look more like ZSH.
Upon logging into a Kali terminal or console, users may be presented with a __message from Kali developers__ that will point them to more information about that specific installation, in case they need it for troubleshooting

The most interesting part is that, Kali Linux 2020.4 now comes with a number of new tools to play with:
* Metasploit Framework v6 (a tool for developing and executing exploits against remote target machines)
* CertGraph (a tool to crawl the graph of certificate Alternate Names)
* Apple bleee (a tool for getting info about nearby iPhones – device name, OS version, phone number, etc. – by sniffing Bluetooth traffic)
* dnscat2 (a tool for creating an encrypted C&C channel over DNS)
* FinalRecon (an automatic web reconnaissance tool)
* goDoH (a Command and Control framework that uses DNS-over-HTTPS)
* hostapd-mana (a rogue access point)
* Whatmask (a program that helps with network settings)

Kali NetHunter, the distro’s mobile pentesting platform, has a new settings menu for easier back up and restore of configuration files, and a module that ensures persistence of the Magisk Android rooting system.

Win-KeX 2.5, which provides a Kali Desktop Experience for Windows Subsystem for Linux, comes with a new Enhanced Session Mode for ARM devices and a few other tweaks.

<h1>VHEditor - Visual Studio Code for Android</h1>

  <p><p>These days I live in VSCode.  I confess to having developed a hardened opinion of Microsoft in years past, but I have been impressed with their work in recent years.  O365 runs like a champ in a browser.  Teams is a really well done application, which I&rsquo;ve come to <em>prefer</em> over Zoom and (especially) Webex.  But VScode is in a league of it&rsquo;s own.  I didn&rsquo;t know how much I needed a really well done IDE, but it&rsquo;s become a must-have.</p>
<p>I use VSCode for writing this blog.  There are extensions that make working with MarkUp easy and that facilitate uploading to Github.  I use the built-in terminal to execute Hugo commands while I&rsquo;m working (like <em>hugo server -D</em> to preview articles in a browser).  The workspace allows me to move files around or quickly move between files for comparison or editing.</p>
<p>I also use VSCode to write Python (again, with some great extensions).  The biggest surprise is that I&rsquo;ve moved my notes into VSCode.  I sync my notes to a private Github repo, so that I can make them available on whichever machine I&rsquo;m working with.  I used to use Simplenote for this, and there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Simplenote.  But by handling this in VSCode I can consolidate tools.</p>
<p><img src="/vheditor.png#floatright" alt="VHEditor">
I am going to do some traveling and it occurred to me that I didn&rsquo;t want to lug a laptop.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be <em>cool</em> if I could use my Kindle HD for VSCode?  I already travel with the Kindle for books, and VSCode would fit in the 8&quot; display.  It seemed possible, but looking through the Google Play store didn&rsquo;t turn up a Microsoft VSCode app.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when I stumbled on VHEditor.  But the story goes a little further back to two other projects I&rsquo;ve been watching with interest: VSCodium and Code-Server.</p>
<p>VSCode is mostly open source, with some &ldquo;special&rdquo; parts added onto the FOSS bits.  Microsoft add telemetry, the gallery, a logo and other pieces.  VSCodium takes the open pieces and compiles a clean version with no telemetry.  The downside is that Microsoft prohibits clones from accessing the VS Code Marketplace, which means that some extensions you need aren&rsquo;t available.  An open Marketplace is available at <a href="https://open-vsx.org">open-vsx.org</a>, but not all extensions are published to that service yet.  For me, the Github extension I use is an issue, so I currently use the original MicroSoft version.  But I like VSCodium and have used it a lot.</p>
<p>Code-Server takes the same source code and produces a web version.  I don&rsquo;t have a use-case for Code-Server currently, but it seems like a fascinating idea.  All of this brings us back to VHEditor.</p>
<p><img src="/vheditorpic.jpeg#floatleft" alt="VHEditor in action"></p>
<p>VHEditor takes Code-Server and Termux and creates a space in the Android OS for this to run.  There&rsquo;s a terminal that works and code-server is running locally.  Basically, when you run VHEditor, it starts Code-Server and accesses it via a loopback address.  VHEditor runs pretty well on my Kindle HD - paired with a small bluetooth keyboard, I can definitely use this to write notes and blog posts.  I have cloned multiple repositories down to the Kindle.</p>
<p>It feels like there are some kinks to work out.  You use &ldquo;pkg install git&rdquo; on the terminal to setup Git (there&rsquo;s a note about this on GitHub), and that format makes me wonder if it&rsquo;s running in a BSD container.  Also, the first repo I cloned worked straight from VHEditor.  The second required me to <strong>git clone</strong> from the shell.  Still, the result is not only usable but useful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve expressed the opinion that the secret sauce in IT right now is Git + Python + WebAPIs.  VSCode has become this tool that fits into that mix of products perfectly.  VHEditor allows me to bring that all the way down to my tablet and is definitely worth a look.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with VSCode, you know there&rsquo;s a lot of things on the screen.  I have a large phone, but I just don&rsquo;t see this being useful on a display below 8&quot;.  You are also really going to need a bluetooth keyboard, especially to use any of the key combinations.  The app is currently sitting at 3 1/2 stars - I read through the reviews and the issues I see relate to unfamiliar or less technical users.  Be prepared to put a little thought into it, but I recommend checking this out.</p>

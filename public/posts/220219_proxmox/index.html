<h1>Problems with Proxmox VE</h1> 
  <h6><div style="text-align: right"><i>by Brent Stewart</a>  on Saturday, Feb 19, 2022</i><br></div></h6>
  <p><p>Look, I know you&rsquo;re reading this, but sometimes I write these posts for myself.  To remind myself of how I built or repaired something.  This is one of those posts.</p>
<p>My home server ran VMWare ESXi for a long time.  I had trouble upgrading it from 6.5 and I was intrigued by Proxmox VE and putting my home network more firmly in the open source camp.  I&rsquo;ve been running Proxmox VE 7.1 for a while now.</p>
<h2 id="quick-review-of-pve">Quick review of PVE</h2>
<p>My experience with PVE has been mixed.  VMWare hid a lot of it&rsquo;s Linux base, where PVE is like an opinionated distro aimed at virtualization.  With PVE, you are definitely administering a debian derivitive box.  PVE will host VMs and also does OS-level containers, which is an interesting take and seems to conserve processor.  I implemented my internal servers this way and it&rsquo;s indistinguishable from a full VM in terms of use    .</p>
<p>Probably the biggest &ldquo;issue&rdquo; is that I use VMWare Workstation to have a Windows VM on my Linux machine.  Workstation was a pretty good front-end for ESXi and you could migrate loads between the two.  Obviously, that use case is out the window now.</p>
<p>Generally, PVE runs as good as or better than ESXi.  However, on the occassion that something goes sideways you are combing through blog posts and support forums (assuming you don&rsquo;t have a subscription, which I don&rsquo;t for home).  I like that the things I learn in PVE are transferable to Linux and vice versa, but I wouldn&rsquo;t make PVE your first experience with Linux.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-the-show">Back to the show</h2>
<p>Power went out at the house the other night and the VMs (actually OS-level containers, but that&rsquo;s arduous to say and if I abbreviate it OSLC no one will know what I&rsquo;m nattering on about) storage had an issue.  When PVE tried to load those volumes it gave an error <em>&ldquo;activating LV &lsquo;pve/data&rsquo; failed: Activation of logical volume pve/data is prohibited while logical volume pve/data_tmeta is active. (500)&quot;</em></p>
<p>I tried several approaches to resolve this.  You can see the error from the PVE command line via <strong>lsblk</strong>.  What actually worked was to make the interfering volumes inactive. Seems obvious, but I needed the command <strong>vgchange</strong>.  As a note, after I deactivated <em>tmeta</em> I got an error because <em>tdata</em> was active so I had to deactivate that as well.</p>
<pre><code>#deactivate the offending volume
lvchange -an pve/data_tmeta
##activate the expected volumes
vgchange -ay
</code></pre>
<p>So this post is a note to myself for the next time.  Hopefully it&rsquo;s helpful to you as well.</p>

<h1 id="googles-move-to-rcschat">Google&rsquo;s move to RCS/Chat</h1>
<p>You really shouldn&rsquo;t care about Google&rsquo;s supported messaging app.  They certainly don&rsquo;t.  They change ideas about messaging more often then their underwear.  Still, they&rsquo;ve made a move from SMS to RCS recently and they&rsquo;re taking you along with them.</p>
<p>SMS is about thirty years old.  It allows 160 character messages and has features built in to support carrier billing.  Despite it&rsquo;s limitations, it&rsquo;s become the default way to communicate for a certain portion of the population and a part of nearly everyone&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Apple has led the way in showing the limitations of SMS with their chat app.  SMS is run by the carriers, who have seen it as a cash-cow and not an area for innovation.  Apple didn&rsquo;t try to shoe-horn their offering onto SMS, they built a whole new IP-based application.  Apple added in features like end-to-end encryption for privacy, read receipts, activity indicators, and high-res photos.</p>
<p>Google has recently been shamed for the poor state of messaging on Android and as a result has tried to create an alternative to iMessage around RCS.  Google&rsquo;s take on RCS is called Chat, and there&rsquo;s a protocol built out to support the new service.  Chat takes up many of the improvements that iMessage (and others) have brought to messaging - things like read receipts, activity indicators, and integration with video.  It <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> include support for end-to-end encryption.  I&rsquo;ve heard this is in development, but I&rsquo;m suspecious that the carriers are loath to give up access to the data.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-care">Should you care?</h2>
<p><img src="/digits_app.png#floatsmallleft" alt="Digits"></p>
<p>No.  As mentioned, if this effort fails it will become the new cherry on the pile of failed messaging apps from Google.  If it succeeds, it will work like Slack/iMessage/etc and you won&rsquo;t really think about it.</p>
<p>I have a bit of a unique case.  My personal phone is an S9 and I have a seperate work phone.  My personal carrier, T-Mobile, has a DGITS app that carries your T-Mobile phone number to another device via IP.  So I have the DIGITS app on my work phone and only have to carry one phone.  DIGITS supports voice and text - SMS texts.  I leave my personal phone turned on at my desk at home.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-chat">Disabling Chat</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been missing texts in DIGITS that come to the old phone.  It didn&rsquo;t make sense until I spoke to a close friend (Hi Mike!) and he mentioned RCS and speculated that since I was missing his texts maybe my app didn&rsquo;t support it.  He tested by turning off RCS when communicating with me.</p>
<p>So this leads to my current theory: when users message my personal number, my home phone negotiates chat and receives the message, leaving my DIGITS app out of the loop.  I&rsquo;ve resolved this by going into my personal phone and turning off &ldquo;chat&rdquo; and forcing it to use SMS.</p>
<p>To do this, open the (Google) messages app and choose the three vertical dots to find the settings.  Under settings, choose <em>chat features</em>.  That brings you to the options shown on the left.  The first option - Enable chat features - is the one that disables the chat protocol.</p>
<p>This is a solution for folks that have two places to receive texts, which is a small group.  It&rsquo;s not a bad tradeoff.  I don&rsquo;t really care about longer bodies of texts or the little blinking activity indication.  If Chat supported end-to-end encryption I might reconsider and hopefully DIGITS will support chat before I have to make that choice.</p>

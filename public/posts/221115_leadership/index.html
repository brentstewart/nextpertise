<h1>Wisdom in 17 sayings</h1> 
  <h6><div style="text-align: right"><i>by Brent Stewart  on Tuesday, Nov 15, 2022</i><br></div></h6>
  <p><p>I grab onto quotes.  Some I hold onto long enough to consider and they pop up in conversation at odd times.  Others seem to bubble up consistently.  To me, these favorite quotes are the compass that I use to retain my sense of direction in difficult times and circumstances.</p>
<p>Folks who have worked with me over the years will have heard versions of these sayings (and probably some that I am forgetting right now).  Some may complain for hearing them too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m preparing for a new job and thinking about how I want to approach new responsibilities.  I&rsquo;ve never tried to compile a list but it&rsquo;s a good time for reviewing these touchstones.  I wanted to share that list with you.</p>
<p>So here are sixteen sayings pertinent to leadership, collected over about that many years of leading.  I&rsquo;ve tried to organize these into themes.  I&rsquo;ve researched attribution and exact quote where possible.</p>
<h1 id="general">General</h1>
<p>These sayings can be employed in a variety of circumstances.</p>
<p>I heard this first while teaching computer networking at Camp Lejeune.  I was told it was an &ldquo;old Marine Corps saying&rdquo;, which I suppose is like the Klingons talking about Shakespeare &ldquo;in the original Klingon&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re going, any road will get you there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lewis Carroll</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I had a wonderful boss in the early &rsquo;teens.  He coached me on promotions and, as best I remember, here&rsquo;s his advice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to be promoted, take responsiblity.  Being responsible attracts opportunities, and eventually someone in management will say &ldquo;get that guy a hat&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>John Phelan</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I first heard this last one from <strong>12 Rules for Life</strong> by Jordan Peterson.  The metaphor, about self-discipline and being in control of yourself and your emotions, struck a chord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you get hurt, say, by an arrow, that is pain. . .  However, there is a second arrow, which is your reaction to the arrow, the getting angry, the planning revenge, this is beyond pain, this is suffering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buddhist saying</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="on-preparation">On Preparation</h1>
<p>Ideally, we&rsquo;d anticipate possible issues and make plans to mitigate.  These quotes deal with the issues and rewards of being ready.</p>
<p>These start with some cynical reminders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bad security looks just like good security until seriously attacked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bruce Schneier</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>and one of my favorites in the same vein.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a plan until they get hit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Tyson</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Two of my former CIOs gave me solid advice about preparation that I&rsquo;ve carried forward in my career.  Mike said the first when talking about the constraints of budgeting, but it&rsquo;s a good reminder to not over-commit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only fit 5 lbs of sugar into a 5 lb bag.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Cross</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Kap intimidated me in those days and I regret not getting to know him better.  He had a very clear vision about the way the world works, illustrated below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play the cards you&rsquo;ve got in your hand, not the ones you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kap Kim</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I saved the best for last.  I use this to encourage preparation and to commend it&rsquo;s results.  I saw Gregg Easterbrook attribute this to Bear Bryant in a Tuesday Morning Quaterback article, but it turns out the original quote is from Neyland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gentlemen, touchdowns follow blocking as sure night follows day.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Robert Neyland</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As I recall, Easterbrook added the aside that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a lot of fun to run a hundred yards when everyone in front of you is on their back.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="on-troubleshooting">On Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Troubleshooting requires deep understanding.  It is often denigrated, but I&rsquo;ve always found it to require tremendous imagination and to reward patience and persistence.  I&rsquo;ve had many opportunities to mentor troubleshooting over the years and here are some of my favorite aphorisms.</p>
<p>This first was one of Dad&rsquo;s favorites.  As it has become well known, it&rsquo;s grown a little trite but still makes a great point for technologists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abraham Maslow</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Many times the way forward is not clear.  Here I took an example from being a parent.  This has always been solid advice because there&rsquo;s always some technical cruft that can be cleared up and the act of cleaning either reveals the issue or puts the person in the right headspace.  Although Peterson has a similar saying, mine preceeded his.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My kids would ask me if I&rsquo;ve seen their favorite toy.  I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;No, but I bet if you clean your room you&rsquo;ll find it&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brent Stewart</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No one likes change, but sometimes troubleshooting presents opportunities to move forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You never let a serious crisis go to waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rohm Emmanuel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="on-people">On people</h1>
<p>Many of these, such as the &ldquo;second arrow&rdquo; also address dealing with other people.  These are the two best quotes I have specifically on the topic of the trials of co-workers.</p>
<p>My father could be pithy and a little cynical, but he understood something about people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you went to the mall and gave out $20 bills at the door, someone would compain that you didn&rsquo;t have change or were at the wrong door.  You cannot make everyone happy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bill Stewart</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve carried around this quote since I was a kid.  I think I picked it up from reading Robert Heinlein.  It, or something like it, has been said in various forms for a long time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hanlon&rsquo;s razor, perhaps a restatement from Winston Churchill</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Extreme Ownership</strong> as a book is like a Mel Brooks movie - everyone remembers just the bits that hit it out of the park.  Still, there&rsquo;s an undeniable relevation about leadership in this quote and I repeat it when mentoring young managers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s not what you preach, it&rsquo;s what you tolerate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jocko Willink</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="on-gratitude">On Gratitude</h1>
<p>I finish with the subject that has most influenced my &ldquo;mature&rdquo; years.  I&rsquo;ve worked to become a grateful person and to recognize that I&rsquo;m blessed in myriad ways.  To list just three: I have a wonderful wife and amazing children, I have friends around the world who want nothing but good for me, and I have the opportunity to do meaningful work.  Focusing on those gifts has brought a peace and happiness to my life.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I thought that Stoicism was depressing.  I&rsquo;ve come to realize that it provides perfect perspective for a grateful life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is more honorable than a grateful heart.</p>
<ul>
<li>Seneca</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>and also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.</p>
<ul>
<li>Epictetus</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I sincerely hope that - if you take nothing else - these thoughts on gratitude will resonate and be useful.  As a Christian, I&rsquo;ll end with the most meaningful quote to me, taken from the end of the Sermon on the Mount.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark 6:34</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

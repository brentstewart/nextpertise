      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to load Chrome OS in VMWare Workstation the other day and got the message &amp;ldquo;No 3D Support is available&amp;rdquo;.  Apparently this is required for Chrome OS to boot.  I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the message on other VMs, but never needed to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assumed this was an issue with Chrome OS at first and tried several versions including &amp;ldquo;CloudReady&amp;rdquo;.  I was using the build put together by FydeOS and had a chance to talk with him on Telegram about the issue.  He recommended I look through a question on AskUbuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I edited &lt;strong&gt;.vmware/preferences&lt;/strong&gt; and added the following line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mks.gl.allowBlacklistedDrivers = &amp;ldquo;TRUE&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome OS booted without a problem!  I had VMs on ESXi that I was accessing via Workstation, and this also resolved the issue for them.  If you are interested in running a ChromeOS VM, I suggest checking out FydeOS.  My testing has been smooth and they have a Telegram channel that is super helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
